The objective of this program is to create a path, a real course to guide the learning of cursors, a fork of VS Code, in order to create Android applications respecting libraries, dependencies, and all the correct steps so that the creation process correctly returns the start of the application in the right way.

Follow the course, using cursors you can have the details of the course. 

The AI you choose to use will not only allow you to configure the cursor environment correctly but also guide you in programming, creating the code that you will need to accept step by step in the correct file of the folder.
The course path, complete with modules, lessons, and exercises, also includes an evaluation to be checked in the course program file.
